<h1>Connecting and streaming to Arcade Pit</h1>

<p>Hey you must've been invited to the show! Cool, but I expect you'll take the time to set things up properly beforehand. this guide will cover every little detail of getting your OBS in top shape for the broadcast. Feel free to ask me questions if you're having trouble.</p>

<p>Note: if you're a savvy OBS user, you won't need this guide. Here is everything you need, summed up: Set your broadcast to "Custom Server" with the FMS URL: rtmp://racebox.in/ap (I will give you the path/stream key when we start). Set your resolution to 512x448, FPS: 60, Bitrate: 1000. No need to stream audio or mic, discord will do that part. Create scenes for all 3 emulators and mspaint (you may have to use Monitor Capture on the Fusion emulator). Make sure you have the most recent <a href="http://racebox.in/arcade/arcadefiles/"><b>files packs</b></a>.</p>

<p>Everyone will need this open as well, the show viewer: <a href="http://racebox.in/flowviewer/viewerpit.html?k=ap"><b>Arcade Pit Viewer.</b></a> This will let you view everyone in real time. My screen will be the 5th one, mute everyone but me (don't worry, my audio is all set up for no echo).</p>

<p>If you need more details or don't know how to use OBS, the information below has step-by-step instructions.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Step 1: Get the packs and software</h2>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="http://racebox.in/arcade/arcadefiles/">Arcade Pit Packs</a></b> - The rom & states pack is usually updated on a weekly basis; make sure you have the latest.</li><br>
<li><b><a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a></b> - Streaming software. This guide uses the Windows build of OBS 0.657. XSplit or OBS-MP will also work.</li></ul>
<hr>
<h2>Step 2: Setting up the emulators</h2>

<p>The emulators are as follows:
<ul><li>fceux.exe - NES emulator</li>
<li>snes9x.exe - SNES emulator</li>
<li>Fusion.exe - Genesis emulator</li></ul>

<p>Set the controls as you see fit for all 3. If you're adjusting the screen size, use a multiplier like 2x or 3x; don't stretch it.</p>

<p>You should also make sure that the roms and states are being found correctly. Open fceu.exe and load 'Batman.' Press 1, to choose state 1, followed by 'P' and it should load the state. If this works, you're in good shape. If not, adjust the folder locations.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Step 3: Configuring OBS Settings</h2>

<p>If you already use OBS, then you probably won't want to mess with your existing settings. So the first thing we will do is make a new scene and profile which you can delete later. If you just installed OBS, skip this step.

<ol><li>Open OBS and click <b>'Profiles' -> 'New'</b> and provide a name.</li>
<li>Next, click <b>'Scene Collection' -> 'New'</b> and provide a name.</li></ol>

<p>Now we don't have to worry about losing your settings. You can switch back to your old profile and scene collection after the show.</p>

<h2>Streaming Settings</h2>

<p>Open up your broadcast settings by going to <b>'Settings' -> 'Settings'</b>, and choose <b>'Encoding'</b> on the left. Set the max bitrate to 1000.</p>

<hr>
<p>Go down the list on the left to <b>'Broadcast Settings'</b> where you will be entering the information for my private server. We use my own server because we need to operate with no delay. Change the following things:</p>

<ol><li>For <b>'Streaming Service'</b> click the drop-down menu and choose <b>'Custom'</b>. This will let you type in the address.</li>
<li>The <b>FMS URL</b> address is <i>rtmp://racebox.in/ap</i></li>
<li>Below the FMS URL is another field called <b>Play Path/Stream Key (if any)</b> which we will leave blank for now. I will give it to you before we start (I can't know it in advance; it depends on the teams). It will be a single digit between 1 and 4.</li></ol>
<img src="OBS2.png">
<hr>
<p>The final setting is on the <b>'Video'</b> section on the left.</p>

<ol><li>Set your Base Resolution here under custom, to 512 x 448. This is the SNES aspect ratio.</li>
<li>Set your FPS to 30 or 60 (preferably 60).</li>
<li>Ensure you are not using any Resolution Downscale</li></ol>

<h2>Step 4: Capture Settings (getting the emulators on OBS)</h2>

<p>Hey, we're nearly done now! The complicated part is over. Now we just need to get those emulators on screen. It's up to you if you want them all on one scene or not. The instructions below will have you create 4.</p>

<p>Back in the main section of OBS, you should see two white boxes on the bottom-left. One says 'Scenes' and the other, 'Sources.' You should already have 1 scene. Right-click on the white box and add 3 more. Rename them to: nes, snes, gen, draw.</p>

<ul><li>Click the nes scene. The emulator has to be running first, or it won't show up to configure... So with fceu.exe open, right-click on the sources box and add a 'window capture.' Pick FCEUX from the dropdown bar and make sure 'capture mouse cursor' is off.</li><br>

<img src="OBS4.png">
<br>
<li>Click the snes scene. with snes9x.exe, you can either do another window capture like before or do a game capture; both should work well but game capture is better. Set it up the same way that FCEU was set up.</li><br>

<li>Click the gen scene. This one is a pain if you're on Windows 7. If you aren't, window capture is fine. For windows 7, you have to either disable Aero or use monitor capture. If you want to use monitor capture, right-click on the sources box and add a 'monitor capture.' Tell it you want to select a sub-region and then click the 'Select Region' button. You'll get a big gray box on your whole monitor. Drag the edges to the insides of your emulator and press enter.</li><br>

<li>For the drawing scene, that's easy. Just open up mspaint (WinKey + R -> 'mspaint.exe') and use window capture. By the way, other drawing programs are against the rules!</li></ul>

<p>Okay, now let's make sure everything looks right. Click the 'Preview Stream' button on the bottom right and whatever scene you're selecting should show up. You can switch them on the fly by selecting them below.</p>

<p>The easiest way to get them to fit the screen properly is to click on the source and press Ctrl-F. It should fit to screen. If not, you can force it to size by clicking 'Edit Scene.' This will let you drag it around directly in the preview window, and resize it too. MSPaint is the one you want only canvas for, so you'll have to do this to get that one to look good.</p>

<p>You don't need to stream audio, so just click on that red mic and red speaker icon to disable them. Ultimately, your OBS should look like this!</p>

<p>Lastly, there is the matter of the show viewer itself: <a href="http://racebox.in/flowviewer/viewerpit.html?k=ap"><b>Arcade Pit Viewer</b></a>. This will let you watch everyone in nearly real-time. My screen will be the 5th one, mute everyone but me (don't worry, my audio is all set up for no echo).</p>

<p>That's everything! This was long-winded but it really comes down to a handful of settings. Again, I can go over anything with you if you need help. Thanks!</p>
